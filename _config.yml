  I am an experienced data scientist/researcher who worked on a variety of data-driven products in both academia and industry. I had the privilege of working on self-driving cars at Uber, natural language processing at Amazon, designing complex data features at startups, working on cutting-edge machine learning research with my advisor, and many more. My core strength is in understanding the problem from multiple perspectives and integrating that understanding into tangible deliverables. 
  I care deeply about improving the lives of people through my work; and I sincerely believe in the power of technology and data intelligent systems to do so. I'm currently looking for my next project, so please feel free to reach out.
