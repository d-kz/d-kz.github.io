{{page.about}} 


I currently work as a machine learning engineer at the Brown Institute’s Local News Lab. I started at Amazon Alexa as an NLP applied scientist, where I learned industry ML standards and worked on pushing cutting edge research into Alexa production. There, I worked on such problems as data-efficient annotation, debiasing Alexa evaluation metrics, and semi-supervised learning. My professional goal is to produce technology that helps people; often, by complementing natural human creativity with AI algorithms and infrastructures.

I am Russian-American, feeling my cultural roots closely tied to both countries. My pursuit of mathematical elegance is what led me to major in Applied Math and Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder. There, I did my thesis work in machine learning, advised by Michael Mozer. In my free time, I like to appreciate nature (i.e. shred waves and powder) and the design of things – everything from market design to photography.
