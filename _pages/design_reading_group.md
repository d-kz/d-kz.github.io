## 7: (Denis) Japanese Design
Initially, was going to read framework type of textbook on design, but realized I disagree with their pitch of design as solely a search through some problem space to satisfy given constraints. As an antithesis, thought of Japanese minimalism and this is more a design through artistic lens. 
### Reading:
- Patricia Graham, _Japanese Design: Art, Aesthetics & Culture_: Chapter 1

## 5: (Will) Market Ethics
After having studied theoretical market design and it's use in the world, we discussed questions of how to use market design to design ethical systems. This week the reading starts with a exploration into current ethical problems in both theoretical markets and real digital markets using marker theory at their core. Then, it covers both practical and theoretical guides to solving these problems, as well as a study of the problems that can arise when using the obvious solutions to problems such as discrimination.

- Theoretical Work:
	- Racial Discrimination in Labor Markets with Posted Wage Offers, Lang et Al., 2015 (Only introduction needed but the whole paper was fascinating)

## 4: (Denis) Marketplce Design
Any exchange of something between two or more parties could be seen as a market. Market design is used in medical student matching, online advertisement bidding, kidney exchange programs, etc. It has a strong theoretical foundation and very intuitive applications, which makes it pretty sweet to study.
