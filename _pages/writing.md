## Entrepreneurship 
[New Venture Challenge](https://www.colorado.edu/nvc/) is an entrepreneurship competition within the city of Boulder, open to alumni and students. Participation across all departments is enocouraged. 
- **PerfectFit** ([strategy executive summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/PerfectFit_summary.pdf), [pitch deck]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/PerfectFit_slides.pdf)). Part of New Venture Challenge 2016/2017. Our project won the IT track of the competition that year. 
	- **mentored by**: [Richard Han](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/richard-han), [Angela Thieman Dino](https://www.colorado.edu/engineeringleadershipprogram/angela-thieman-dino)
	- There is a solid dozen of companies trying to address this problem from a variety of angles. Our team was offered to be "incubated" within a company that produced 3D sensors and was also aiming at that market. But I was burnt out and thankfully chose an internship that summer instead. 

- **CustomerInsights** ([demo]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/customerInsights_wine.pdf)). Part of New Venture Challenge 2015/2016. Being busier that year, I didn't compete, but still followed through with an idea till a working prototype and a sound business model. Simply put, CustomerInsights was trying to find patterns within user feedback to help business act upon structured user critique. It was my first time learning about and using word embeddings. I found an NLP professor - [Jordan Boyd Graber](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/) within the department and consulted him about how to approach my problem. He introduced me to his then PhD student - [Md Arafat Sultan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VKKAfwMAAAAJ&hl=en) - who pointed me towards sentence alignment and word embeddings. Later, Jordan also introduced me to Mike, who became my research advisor in the end.

	- Later, I heard of a few business who do sentiment and market anaysis, akin to this idea, for companies to see how customers perceive a product or a firm. 

- **Howard** ([strategy executive summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/Howard.pdf)). Part of New Venture Challenge 2014/2015. A 'graduation' project of what was only an entrepreneurship _class_ at the time, but later became [CS Entrepreneurial Capstone](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/current-students/undergraduate-students/senior-capstone/entrepreneurial-capstone) option. It was my first time competing in the entrepreneurship scene and it was nerve-racking, but exhilirating and exciting. Even though I didn't even come close to placing that year, it defined a long-term interest of seeing the world for what it could be, not what it is.

	- Later that summer, I attended a meetup at a consultancy firm that did exactly this, but without a platform; instead, relying on personal connections.
